COMP3900 Diary Summarised
Week 1
Formed a team with Kevin and Sharon, we decided on doing Project 6, the
waiter project. For frontend, we will be using React with Nodejs since
a lot of companies use it. We will also be using Typescript since it is
easier to debug. I decided I will do frontend development. I started 
researching reactjs and typescript.
Downloaded the necessary packages required to run the starter code that Kevin
put on Github. I installed a new code editor Visual Studio Code and also
many extensions.
I also started working on the Project Proposal (Week 3 deliverables), the
user stories and problem statement. Signed up to Jira and scoped it out.

Week 2
I started working on designing the wireframes and finished first draft for our
system and continued working on our project proposal.
kav and Noah joined out team since they had a team of 2. They originally wanted
to do the stock market project. We had most of the project proposal done.
We brainstormed what would make our system unique, and Kav came up with having
a recommendations system that would analyse data to recommend items to customers,
having a takeout option.
We looked through Kevin's design of the database, and out of nowhere, there was
this debate about the redundancy of id being an int.


Week 3
I started working on HTML and CSS of some of our pages, continued improving wireframes,
along with doing background research for the report and styling it.
Had a standup meeting, we were all working on the project proposal. Needed to finalise
epics and user stories, add wireframes to report, explain system flow, set out project
sprints.

Week 4
I started making react app from scratch and worked on creating the login page. I spent
most of the week resting...
We decided that Kevin will work on integrating backend with frontend and customer pages,
while I will work on Staff pages.

Week 5
Got login and register pages working and connected to backend. Finished most components
for staff pages, still need to add javascript to it and connect to backend. Nav bar is
working, I wrote some pseudocode for planning purposes, cleaned up the struture a bit.
Backend seems to be working very hard on making hte database.

Week 6
Spent most of my time trying to connect frontend to backend. Finally connected wait staff
and kitchen staff to backend. We were advised to focus on the recommendations section of
our system as it what makes our system unique, hence I started working on designing,
brainstorming and planning how we should process the data. I finished first draft of
manage staff. Still waiting on approval of my teammates.

Week 7
Spent the week cleaning code and connecting to backend. Spent the weekend trying to 
make frontend for edit menu. Lack of communications between team members this week.

Week 8
We had a team meeting and clarified what needed to be done by next week, we seem
to be on track. Kav is working on socket.io it should be working by next week,
Sharon will be helping Kevin with the menu, Noah is working on backend overall,
fixing all issues and I'll be finishing off the edit menu epic.
I finished edit menu and started working on testing and debugging, and cleaning code.

Week 9
Working on notifications, debugging and testing system. Preparing for project demo.
